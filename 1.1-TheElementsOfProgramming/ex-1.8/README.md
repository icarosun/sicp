Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure. (In section [1.3.4](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_sec_1.3.4) we will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)
